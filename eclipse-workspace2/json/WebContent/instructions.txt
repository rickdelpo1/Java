start tomcat server workspace2

run in browser
http://localhost:8080/json/jqgrid_demo.html

then enter... select * from recruiters..the hard coded default query
                                             ** see col model servlet for 12-27 instructions on the auto version


ctrl shift J shows console, if there is cors issue

col model and col model 2 need to auto load my query similar to getting it in Ajax handler
                                                   on dec 27 I reviewed code and now tests are needed
also need to do one connection for all the separate servlets
    see manage cars original program for connection class
    
    
    
    note startscript and manage cars used for js front end
    pro builder servlet is for create table
    
    new idea on 7-11-2020...send response object from pro builder servlet back to js after table created withFA and anchor tag....see text area notes
    also add drop to case statement so we now have create and drop plus others as needed. No need for select here because startscript does that
    
    see tables.java in workspace 3 for retrieving table names from sqlite...we will use this to show all tables to user after create new table
      each table has clickable anchor tag to select all statement and has FA icon preceeding
