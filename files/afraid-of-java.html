<h1 class="font_0">Afraid of JAVA ?</h1>

<p>see the word JAVA and just cringe or want to run? Have an aversion to programming?</p>

<p></p>

<p>What about learning just enough to get by or even better, just enough to boast to your peers that u know it&hellip;.u dont have to know ALL of it...no one ever said that</p>


<p>For reading data off a spreadsheet and displaying back in a browser we have no choice but to use a programming language to do this. But it is possible to do with bare bones knowledge and this is why u are at this site. We use a copy and paste approach and then learn the rest later.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Your net worth goes up and your employability is definitely &nbsp;impacted because u are more well rounded or at least u are trying to be</p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If u really want to skip the java part for now, at minimum, go to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://www.cloudwithasilverlining.com/tutorial-4" target="_self">tutorial 4</a></span> and do only the part where we download SQLite and do some SQL at the command prompt. Or try some SQL live online with <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="https://www.cloudwithasilverlining.com/tutorial-7" target="_self">tutorial 7</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then u need to decide if programming is something u might like</p>

<p></p>

<p>Or u can quit all together like i did many times</p>

<p></p>

<p>Consider learning Java and SQL together</p>

<p></p>

<p>We only need to know 4 concepts for the JAVA side:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Http</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Request and response</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Jdbc</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Java.sql</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Here are 7 basic concepts in SQL:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Create db schema</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Create table inside db</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Insert some data</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Select and display data</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Delete data</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Update data in table</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Drop table</p>
	</li>
</ul>
