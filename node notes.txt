5-17-2021     first github public page...has auto ssl without cookie

in github created repo called rickdelpo1.github.io.....this is for github pages
this repo is for my public file, then did sample index and was able to http into it...automatically switched to https

https://rickdelpo1.github.io/index.html


installed brackets prior to node
download binary version of node
installed node.. extract in download folder
open cmd then cd to that download directory
C:\Users\rickd\Downloads\node-v14.17.0-win-x64\node-v14.17.0-win-x64
tested node -v....npm -v  in new working directory


then started exercise

as i went along npm know i had brackets env and put files there
was able to open package.json right in brackets to edit and auto saved

link to exercise   https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f

problems with npm run deploy

1 needed to put home path of node in windows env variables to run npm in my-app folder

upon running npm run build react-scripts not recognized
2 needed to install react-scripts...........4.0.3....also node_modules does have write permission
     changed react-scripts to new version in package.json file

3 react-scripts build cannot find required file index.html
      turned out that when creating react app originally npm was not working so re created react after doing step 1
      now public folder is in my-app with an index file

4 all above fixed, now looks like app is needing git which is not installed yet
     Error: spawn git ENOENT
     we are deploying to git so stands to reason we need git installed 



5-18-2021
installed git  https://gitforwindows.org/   downloads exe...chose brackets as default text editor

Now, create a remote GitHub repository with your app name and go back initialize this
git init
add it as remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:rickdelpo1/my-app.git

need to do above git commands in my-app directory...since git is installed it can run anywhere because env variable auto set and tested

new error

Cloning into 'C:\Users\rickd\Downloads\node-v14.17.0-win-x64\node-v14.17.0-win-x64\my-app\node_modules\.cache\gh-pages\git@github.com!rickdelpo1!my-app.git'...
Host key verification failed.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

looks like we need to set up ssh key and pass


5-25
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
   followed instructions on this link to create ssh key...also note to paste into git click at prompt and then right click and choose paste

    could not get to work npming from node directory
    found new tut......https://medium.com/@itIsMadhavan/how-to-deploy-react-app-to-github-pages-7e7d5fc3449c
        found out all commands need to be executed from git....i was in wrong dir...need to tell beginner about this
                    my clue was that i saw the $ in the tutorial code
    other issues  ...add remote origin..needed to consult with old tut
                                                                https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f

   this part not explained well in new tut
           git init
add it as remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:Yuribenjamin/my-app.git

....also when prompted for pass just press enter and not ok button
new project installed in users/rickd folder under my-app
needed to edit package.json file...used brackets in my-app folder and then resaved

run npm start from git to pull up localhost 3000

xed out of git and got new connection and redid gatsby develop and it worked

test2 is successful...node_modules folder did not get created in project..I added all project dependencies manually
looks like audit from yesterday added the unwanted folder which was 300 megs
all my research shows that build gets dependencies from node_modules folder in master and not in project directory

****deployed gatsby mukul-jain to github pages

     https://blog.bitsrc.io/deploy-a-gatsby-site-on-github-pages-for-free-f18853c1b7a9

First, add the GitHub repository name to your gatsby-config.js file. In this example, we will assume that your GitHub repository is my_project.
module.exports = {
  pathPrefix: "/my_project",
}
Next, add a custom command deploy to your package.json file.
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public"
  }
}
This creates a deploy command which first creates the static version of your site with the prefix of /my_project/ for every URL and then pushes the public directory using the gh-pages plugin

Next, add the GitHub repository as the origin remote to your Gatsby Git repository by running the following command:
git remote add origin https://username.github.com/my_project

Thereafter, you need to run the custom script to build the site and push it to GitHub.
npm run deploy

This will push the data to the gh-pages branch of your repository, without adding any commits to other branches



5-29  added git perspective to eclipse so i can push old eclipse projects
      also want to push to different branches to accomodate older eclipse projects vs new ones

      dont forget to include sqlite origin from desktop...store this somewhere
      also be able to add personal notes like this whole page and text area notes page and instructions page
      make separate folders for puzzle, javasqlweb.org and blog section, so i can show index files for each
